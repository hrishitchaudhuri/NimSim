### NOTES:
1. `docs` contains documentation for the project built using sphinx. To access it, run `./docs/_build/html/index.html` in your favourite browser. <br/>
Alternatively, NumPy style docstrings have been provided for each function in the `src` folder. <br/><br/>
2. `src` contains the modules used in `main.py` to simulate a nim game. Please do not change directory structure while executing since relative dependencies exist between the modules.
<br/><br/>
3. TODO: Upload a `tests` folder and add Travis CI support.
